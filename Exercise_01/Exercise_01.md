### <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
The SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things Service enables customers and partners to develop, customize, and operate IoT business applications in the cloud. IoT Services provides Lifecycle management at scale for IoT devices from onboarding to decommissioning. It also provides a way to securely connect to remote devices over a broad variety of IoT protocols. It provides gateway Edge which provides one-premise IoT edge processing and also gateway cloud which does centralized cloud based processing. The **IoT cockpit** is the user interface of the solution and provides access to various functions. It is the main interface for users to interact with the Internet of Things core service. It can be used for creating users and tenants, for creating device data models, for device onboarding and for adding new networks. It can also be used to deploy interceptors, retrieve network logs, visualize the data which are being ingested via IoT devices/sensors.

### <a name="creating-device-data-model"></a> Creating device data model
Centralized Device data model provides the schema of device related configurations including the data fields that will be exchanged. Default template is provided and can be downloaded from the SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Things services cockpit. If you have any deviations or additions, a new sensor type can be added to the default central data model. In the below steps, we will extend this default central device data model with the new fields "Temperature and Light" that we will be getting from the device simulator. In this section, you will create few capabilities (measures and commands). A capability can be reused since it can be assigned to multiple sensor types: each capability can have one or many properties.

1.	Open the browser and navigate to the IoT Service Cockpit URL provided by the instructor

	![](images/11.png)

1.	Copy the following JSON script which defines a new capability named **BuzzerController** and paste it in the **Example Value** text area. Then click **Execute**  

	```json
	{
	  "name": "BuzzerController",
	  "properties": [
	    {
	      "formatter": {
	        "swap": false,
	        "dataType": "STRING",

	- **<<< Temperature Capability ID >>>** with the Temperature capability ID
	- **<<< Light Capability ID >>>** with the Light capability ID
	- **<<< BuzzerController Capability ID >>>** with the BuzzerController capability ID

	you have noted down in the previous steps. Once done paste the script in the **Example Value** text area and click **Execute**

	>NOTE: You must use **capabilities IDs** here because **AlternateIDs** are **NOT** used for creating sensor types

	```json
	{
	  "protocol": "*",
	  "capabilities": [
	    {
	      "id": "<<< Temperature Capability ID >>>",
	      "type": "measure"

	![](images/17.png)

1. Congratulations! You have successfully created a new data model.



### <a name="device-and-sensor-onboarding"></a> Device and sensor onboarding
Each device exchange data with a specific protocol (for example: MQTT in this exercise).  Each device corresponds to 1 unique physical node. We need to create physical node that corresponds to a physical device. In the following section, it is described how to create a Device for the MQTT network. Also we onboard all the sensors and Actuators for the Device.

1.	Log on to the IoT Cockpit of SAP Cloud Platform Internet of Thing with the tenant user credentials  
	![](images/18.png)

1.	Use the main menu to navigate to the **Device Management -> Devices** section and click on the "**+**" sign to start the device creation process

	>NOTE: As an alternative, devices and sensors can also be created via APIs. In this exercises, we will create it via UI cockpit  

	![](images/19.png)

1.	In the **General Information** section, enter the following information and click on **Create**


	|Parameter|Value|
	|---------|-----|
	|Name|Paho\_Client\_XX |
	|Gateway|MQTT Network|
	|Alternate ID|11:22:33:XX|

	(where **XX** must be replaced with your group number)

	>NOTE: for the **Alternate ID**, as we are not using actual device and just a Paho MQTT Simulator Client, you can provide any string. This string resembles a MAC address where 4 groups of 2 digits must be sepaarted by colons (:)

	>NOTE: Same MAC address would be required at later steps to be provided in Paho Client as well.  

	![](images/20.png)

1.	Device is listed under available devices. Select the new device and click on the "**+**" sign to create a new sensor  
	![](images/21.png)

1.	In the General Information section, enter a name such as "**EKT-Sensor**", select Sensor Type you have created earlier (i.e. EKTProfile\_XX, where XX must be replaced with your group number) and ignore the Alternate ID as it's optional. This EKT-Sensor automatically provides temperature, light measurements and it also supports a buzzer actuator: these are the capabilities we have previously defined. Once done click on **Add**  
	![](images/22.png)

1.	The new sensor is created and you should be able to see the **EKT-Sensor** under the **Sensors** tab of the Paho\_Client\_XX device onboarded earlier  
	![](images/23.png)

1. Be sure that your Paho Client device is selected, choose the **Certificate** tab and click on **Generate Certificate**  
	![](images/24.png)
1. Choose the Certificate Type **P12** and click **Generate**  
	![](images/25.png)
1. This will trigger a popup windows providing you with a secret key which you must copy and save in notepad. Then click **OK**  
	![](images/26.png)
1. You can also see the downloaded certificate *Paho\_Client\_XX-device\_certificate.p12* in the Chrome browser status bar. Click on the small down arrow and choose **Show in folder**  
	![](images/27.png)

1. This will make you to understand where the certificate is located. Please keep in mind this location since it will be used in the next section  
	![](images/28.png)
1. Congratulations! You have successfully onboarded a new device and a new sensor.


### <a name="mqtt-Paho"></a> Sending messages via MQTT using Paho client
In this step, we will send the data from Device Simulator that supports MQTT protocol. We have already on-boarded this simulator device during previous steps. Once we send the data, it would be received by Internet of Things Gateway Cloud and would be visible in the IoT services cockpit and via APIs.

1.	Launch the **MQTT Paho Client**, it should be located under the *C:\Student\PahoClient* folder  
	![](images/29.png)

	![](images/40.png)

1. Use the default settings for QOS

1. Copy the following JSON script and paste it in a text editor

	```json
	{
	"capabilityAlternateId":[
		"<<< Temperature Capability Alternate ID >>>",
		"<<< Light Capability Alternate ID >>>",
		"<<< BuzzerController Capability Alternate ID >>>"
		],
	"measures":[20,20,"demo"],
	"sensorAlternateId":"<<< Sensor Alternate ID >>>"
	}
	```

1. Replace the **sensorAlternateId** with the **Alternate ID** you can read by going on your **EKT-Sensor** in your **Paho Client**  
	![](images/41.png)

1. Then go to **Sensor Types -> EKTProfile_XX** and click on the first **Action** button for the **Temperature** capability  
	![](images/42.png)

1. Replace the **<<< Temperature Capability Alternate ID >>>** with the Alternate ID of the Temperature capability  
	![](images/44.png)

1. Repeat the previous 2 steps for the other capabilities (Light and BuzzerController). At the end copy the JSON script you have created and paste it in the Message text area of your Paho Client. Then click **Publish**  
	![](images/45.png)

1. A new line is added to the history on the right  
	![](images/46.png)

1. Repeat this step several time each time by changing the values for temperature and light in the  measures section of the JSON file  
	![](images/47.png)

1. At the end you should have a history with several different pubblications  
	![](images/48.png)
