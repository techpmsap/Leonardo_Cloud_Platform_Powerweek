### <a name="create-thing"></a> Create a Thing
In this section you are going to learn how to create a Thing using the SAP IoT AE UI. The Thing is based on the Thing Type you created earlier. Then you will learn how to use the Thing Modeler to create thresholds for temperature and finally how to update the location of the Thing with Postman. This step is required to give this thing a location so it can show up on a map in the UI correctly.

1. Keeping the **small\_greenhouse\_tt\_xx** Thing Type selected, click on the **New Thing** button on the top right corner. This will create a new thing based on the Thing Type you have chosen  
	![](images/035b.png)

1. Enter

	| Parameter | Value |
	| --------- | ----- |
	| Name | small\_greenhouse\_xx |
	| Description | Small Greenhouse xx |
	| Authorization Group | the one starting with "6b569" |
	| Provider | None |
	
	then click on **Save**
	>NOTE: Set first the **Provider** field to **None** so that all other unnecessary fields will go away.  
	
	![](images/036.png)

1. You will get a popup window informing you that a new thing has been created. Please note down in a text editor the **Thing ID**, because it will be required later. Click on **OK**  
	![](images/037.png)

1. This is your new Thing based on the specified Thing Type  
	![](images/038.png)

1. Switch to the **Measured Values** tab, expand the temperature property and enter **[1,10,30,45]** for the 4 thresholds values; then click **Save**  
	![](images/039.png)




### <a name="create-device-model"></a> Create the device model
The created Thing, in order to work properly, needs to be attached to a device. We don't have yet this device so in this chapter we are going to create it in the IoT Service cockpit, together with a sensor and some properties.

1. With Chrome, navigate to the **IoT Service cockpit** address provided by your instructor and login with the related credentials  
	![](images/040.png)

1. Select **Capabilities** and click on the **+** sign to create a new Capability  
	![](images/041.png)

1. Enter the same name you used for the property set when you created your Thing. If you don't do this, then you won't be able to attach your thing with the device, because the metching will not be possible. If you have followed the naming convention used in this exercise, this name should be **sg\_climate\_ps\_xx** where xx must be replaced with your group number. Then click on the **+** sign to create a new property  
	![](images/042.png)

1. Enter

	| Property Name| Property Data Type |
	| --------- | ----- |
	| temperature | float |

	where **xx** is your group number. Then click on **Update**  
	![](images/067.png)

1. Close the popup window from the top right corner  
	![](images/068.png)
	
1. Make sure that the **Postman Interceptor** is enabled  
	![](images/069.png)

1.	On the left-hand side, select **01 Thing Configuration -> Read configuration**. A new tab opens up on the right-hand side containing a GET request to read the package configuration. Some of the variables in the URL request will be replaced by the corresponding ones in the environment you have configured before. Click on **Send**  
	![](images/070.png)

1. You shoudl get a JSON file with all the details about your package configuration  
	![](images/071.png)

1. If the response you get is only an HTML file, it means that there is something wrong. Please check that your Postman Interceptor is enabled and try by signing in again to the Weather Station on Chrome with your credentials  
	![](images/072.png)

1. In the "**wdiot1 iotae apis**" collection, click on **Thing Onboarding -> Fetch csrf token**. Click **Send** and you should receive a "**200 OK**" status code with some JSON in the response body  
	![](images/073.png)

1. On the top right corner, be sure to have the **wdiot1** environment selected, click on the **eye** button and then on **Edit**  
	![](images/074.png)

1. Replace the field **yourthingId** with the **Thing ID** you received when you created the thing. Make sure that a **x-csrf-token** has been created and click on **Update**  
	![](images/075.png)

1. Close the popup window  
	![](images/076.png)

1. Now that we have set the Thing ID in our environment and that we have get a valid **x-csrf-token**, we are ready to create a location for that thing. In the same collection, click on **Thing Onboarding -> Create Location**. Switch to the **body** tab and take a look to the location you are going to create  
	![](images/077.png)

1. If you want you can go to the website <https://www.latlong.net> and find your own location, copy and paste the latitude and longitude in this JSON body and fill the other location details  
	![](images/078.png)

1. When finished changing your location click on **Send**  
	![](images/079.png)

1. The location is created. You should receive a "**201 Created**" message. Note down the **location ID** you received in the headers  
	![](images/080.png)

1. Go to the **Thing Onboarding -> Read the created thing**, click on **Send** and copy in the clipboard the entire response body. In this way we are copying the Thing's metadata, we will use this in the next step  
	![](images/081.png)

1. Go to the **Thing Onboarding -> Update Thing (incl. location)**, delete the current **body** content and paste the one you have in memory, copied in the previous step  
	![](images/082.png)

1. Just above the "\_objectGroup" property, add the line `"_location":"<location_ID>",` where **\<location\_ID\>** must be replaced by the location ID you got in the headers when you created the location (you should have noted down this ID already). Then click **Send** and check that you have received a "**201 Created**" message  
	![](images/083.png)

1. Go to the **Thing Onboarding -> Read the created thing**, click on **Send** and check that the thing has been updates with the new **\_location** property  
	![](images/084.png)

1. The same information can be now read in the IoT Application Enablement cockpit  
	![](images/085.png)
	
1. Congratulations! You have successfully updated your Thing by using Postman REST Client.



### <a name="build-app"></a> Build a SAPUI5 app with SAP Web IDE
In this section you will build a simple SAPUI5 app which allows you to monitor your greenhouses (in this case you have only one) and examine data its connected sensors generate.

1. Open **SAP Web IDE** using the URL provided by your instructor and logon using the related credentials

	![](images/106.png)

1. Congratulations! You have successfully created a SAPUI5 application to analyze IoT data!



### <a name="generate-certificate"></a> Generate the device certificate
Before we can send some data to the device we need to establish a connection with it in Postman. For this we need to use a special certificate provided by the device itself in the IoT Service cockpit

1. Go to your IoT Service cockpit and login with your credentials  
	![](images/107.png)

1. Select Devices, type "sg" in the search box, select your device **sg\_climate\_dev\_xx** (where **xx** is your group number), select the "Certificate" tab and click on **Generate Certificate**  
	![](images/108.png)
	
1. Select "**p12**" as Certificate Type and click **Generate**. The certificate will be generated and you will receive a prompt to save the file on your disk. Please keep in mind where you put it, since it will be required in the next section  
	![](images/109.png)

1. Write down the Secret Key you received and click **OK**  
	![](images/110.png)

1. If you forgot where you saved the certificate, you can click on the small down arrow beside the downloaded file in the Chrome status bar and select Show in Finder(MAC) or View in Explorer (WIN).  
	![](images/111.png)




### <a name="install-certificate"></a> Install the certificate
At this point we need in some way to install the certificate we have downloaded in your system so that it can be used by a REST client like POSTMAN. We are going to illustrate here two distinct procedures for installing this certificate, one for Windows and another for MAC.

#### --- Windows Users ---

1. Open Chrome browser and go to <chrome://settings>  
	![](images/112.png)

1.	Search for SSL in search text field: you get **Manage HTTPS/SSL certificates and settings**. Click on this link  
	![](images/113.png)

1.	Once in the certificate manager, go to the **Personal** tab and click on **Import...**  
	![](images/114.png)

1.	**Certificate Import Wizard** will be opened: click on **Next**  
	![](images/115.png)

1.	Browse to folder where you have saved the p12 certificate and choose "All Files (*.*)" in the file extension drop down list  
	![](images/116.png)

1.	Select the certificate and click **Open**  
	![](images/117.png)

1.	Enter the **secret key** you obtained while downloading device certificate and noted down in a text editor; then click **Next**  
	![](images/118.png)

1. Click **Next**  
	![](images/119.png)

1.	Finally, click on the **Finish** button  
	![](images/120.png)

1.	You should receive the information that the import was successful.  
	![](images/121.png)


#### --- MAC Users ---

1. Open the **Keychain** utility and select **File -> Import Items...**  
	![](images/122.png)

1. Locate the p12 certificate you downloaded earlier  
	![](images/123.png)

1. Enter your MAC credentials if required  
	![](images/124.png)

1. Enter the **secret key** you obtained while downloading the certificate and noted down in a text editor; then click **OK**  
	![](images/125.png)

1. The certificate is imported, but it's not yet trusted. You can see a message saying that this certificate was signed by an unknown authority. Double click on the certificate  
	![](images/126.png)

1. In the **Trust** section choose **Always Trust** for the parameter "When using this certificate"  
	![](images/127.png)

1. Enter your MAC credentials if required and click **Update Settings**  
	![](images/128.png)

1. The certificate is now successfully imported and trusted  
	![](images/129.png)




### <a name="send-data-with-postman"></a> Send some data using Postman and analyze sent data
As final step for this exercise we can send some data to the device using Postman, to see if data is really visible in the SAPUI5 application. Of course this is just a simulation because real data should come to the device from the sensors, but since we don't have physical sensors, we can simply emulate them using REST requests.
However before we can proceed, we need to gather some information from the IoT Services cockpit. What we need is the Device Alternate ID, the Capability Alternate ID and the Sensor Alternate ID of our IoT configuration.

1. Go to the IoT Services cockpit and select **Devices** on the left-hand menu. Filter for your device and select it. On the right page you can read the **Device Alternate ID** in the header and the **Sensor Alternate ID** in the detail row. Note down these two IDs  
	![](images/130.png)

1. Now switch to Capabilities, filter for your capability and get on the right side the **Capability Alternate ID**. Note down this ID  
	![](images/131.png)

1. Now, open Postman and **disable** the Postman Interceptor  
	![](images/132.png)

1.  Create a new request specifying the following configuration:

	- Method: **POST**
	- URL: `https://<host_name>/iot/gateway/rest/measures/<device_alternate_ID>`
	- Click on the Body tab and select the **raw** with **JSON** format
	- In the body section enter the following JSON code
	
	```json
	{
	    "capabilityAlternateId":["<capability_alternate_ID>"],
	    "sensorAlternateId":"<sensor_alternate_ID>",
	    "measures":[{"temperature":25,"humidity":71}]
	}
	```
	
	Of course, you need to replace **\<device\_alternate\_ID\>**, **\<capability\_alternate\_ID\>** and **\<sensor\_alternate\_ID\>** with the values gathered earlier. When finished press the **Send** button  
	![](images/133.png)

1. Select the right certificate (the right one should be the one with the same your Device Alternate ID) and click **OK**  
	![](images/134.png)

1. You should receive a successful response from the server with a status code of "**200 OK**"  
	![](images/135.png)

1. Keep changing measures data in the request body and sending them again. Do it for 5 or 6 times with an interval of 1 or 2 minutes from each other
